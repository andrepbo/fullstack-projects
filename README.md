git clone https://github.com/andrepbo/[project-name].git
cd [project-name]
```

Follow the specific setup instructions for each project.

## Using docker-compose
### Create a .env.local file in the same directory as docker-compose.yml and define:

```ini

If you donâ€™t set these variables, Docker Compose will default to ./backend and ./frontend.
